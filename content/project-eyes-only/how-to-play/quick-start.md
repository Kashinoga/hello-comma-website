## Overview

If you are an experienced role-playing game player, use this guide to quickly get up to speed on how to play.

## Requirements

- A copy of this guide per player
- A standard 52-card deck of playing cards per player
  - Card ranking: `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K A`
- Note taking tools

## Questions

Throughout gameplay, the Game Master will pose questions to the Players. Questions can be directed towards one Player and their Player Character, or towards all Players, and anywhere in-between.

## Challenges

Challenges are a set of questions that Players must answer in order to proceed further in the game. The answers that Players provide for challenges may not always be correct, and wrong answers may be detrimental to the Players. The Game Master verifies answers and may use playing cards in order to help them decide whether or not an answer is a success or a failure.

The Game Master decides which Players are involved in a challenge.

## Playing Cards

Playing cards are used during challenges to help both the Players and the Game Master determine the outcomes of each question.

The following characteristics apply:

- Each player has a standard 52-card deck of playing cards
- The Joker cards are set aside
- Other cards that are not either the number or the face cards are not used
