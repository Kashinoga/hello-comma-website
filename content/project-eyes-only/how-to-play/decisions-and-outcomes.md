## Decisions

A decision is an answer to a question, it can be right or wrong. The Group will be required to make decisions throughout play in the World. Decisions can vary wildly, as there are both simple and complex questions to answer when interacting with the World.

Most simple questions can be answered definitively or rather easily. Complex questions, on the other hand, may require more engagement and thought. The World should be able to pose an entire spectrum of questions for the Players to answer. In turn, the Players may choose to answer questions of their liking, motivated by their own selves and by the World itself.

The Game Master is here to aid the Players in decision making. Certain questions are easy, and the Game Master should confirm their thoughts with these types of questions. This lets both the Players and the World proceed smoothly with questions that are trivial.

Certain questions are hard, and the Game Master should also work with the Players to answer these more complex questions.

In general, a game is a collaboration between the Game Master and the Players to answer questions of varying complexity.

To help answer more complex questions, the Game Master may employ playing cards.

## Question Types

### Question

An outcome from a Question should not require the use of playing cards, and are determined by just using the characteristics of the Player Characters.

#### Trivial Questions

Questions that occur everyday and often require no thought.

#### Easy Questions

Questions that occur daily and often require little to no thought.

### Question I

An outcome from a Question I should generally be determined by the use of both the characteristics of the Player Characters and the playing cards.

#### Medium Questions

Questions that occur infrequently and are often exceptions. A Player generally has a 50/50 chance of being knowledgeable about the question.

#### Hard Questions

Questions that rarely occur and are often unexpected.

### Question II

An outcome from a Question II is generally determined to be impossible for Player Characters. Player Characters generally need more experience and time to resolve this kind of question.

#### Miracle Questions

Questions that are once-in-a-lifetime and are often unimaginable.

### Question Thresholds

The Game Master may choose when playing cards should be used, and the following provides only suggested thresholds, that when reached, then should playing cards be used to help answer questions and determine outcomes.

| Question type   | Use playing cards |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| **Question**    |                   |
| Trivial         | No                |
| Easy            | No                |
| **Question I**  |                   |
| Medium          | Interpretive      |
| Hard            | Yes               |
| **Question II** |                   |
| Miracle         | No                |

## Outcomes

An outcome is what occurs after a question is answered, or a decision is made. Outcomes are generally described and provided by the Game Master. The Game Master can employ characteristics of the Player Characters to determine outcomes. In addition, characteristics provided by the use of playing cards should also inform the Game Master on how outcomes are determined.

## Determining Outcomes

The Game Master identifies the question type and applies the appropriate characteristics to determine the outcome. Characteristics may come from either the Player Characters, the playing cards, or both.

Player Character characteristics may include things like backstory and skills, while playing card characteristics generally involve actions and ratings derived from the playing cards.

## Challenges and Encounters

A challenge occurs whenever questions are being asked. Challenges are used to help group together sets of questions as provided by the Game Master.

An encounter occurs whenever challenges are being answered. Encounters are used to help group together sets of questions and answers as provided by the Group.
