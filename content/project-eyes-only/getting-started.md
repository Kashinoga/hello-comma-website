#### Conflict Engagement

Once a threshold is met or exceeded during a Conflict Encounter, a Conflict Engagement occurs as determined by the Game Master. She may choose to ignore an encounter even though a threshold is met.

This Engagement allows the Group to resolve the Conflict before proceeding with the Party's next action.

Each Player in the Party will take turns in order to process the Conflict Encounter.

The following describes how to resolve a Conflict Encounter.
