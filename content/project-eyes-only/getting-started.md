## Basic Setup

A game involves setting up the following.

1. Designate one person as the Game Master
2. In any order: the Game Master creates a World, and the Players each create their own Player Characters
3. The Group decides on the date and time for a Session

## Basic Gameplay

A simplified gameplay loop is as follows.

1. The Game Master describes the relevant state of the World
2. The Players describe their actions
3. The Game Master describes the consequences to the Players' actions
4. Conflicts between the Players and the World will occur
5. Use the tools provided by the game to solve the conflicts
6. Repeat these steps

## Conflict

This section describes what a Conflict is and how Players interact with it.

#### The Basics

A conflict is a disagreement between Players and the World. The World can include many entities that conflict with the Player, such as: another Player, Non-Player Characters, and the World's environment.

#### Examples

A conflict may occur between a Player and the following:

- Another Player
- A Non-Player Character
- The environment
  - Monsters, terrain, and the climate and weather

## Conflict Resolution

This section describes how to use the tools provided in order to resolve Conflicts.

### Primary Tool

This is the tool that Groups will use to ultimately determine the outcome of Conflicts.

#### The Playing Cards

Players will use a standard deck of cards as their Primary Tool to resolve Conflicts. A standard deck of cards, also known as a French deck, contains the following qualities:

- 52 total cards
  - 13 ranks of cards, with 4 of each card in each rank
    - 9 number cards: 2 through 10
    - 4 face cards: jack, queen, king, and ace
  - 4 suits: spades, clubs, diamonds, and hearts
  - 2 colors: diamonds and hearts are in red, while spades and clubs are in black
  - Joker cards are not included in the deck unless otherwise stated

### How to Resolve Conflicts

#### The Basics

The following offers a high-level understanding of using the Primary Tool to resolve conflicts.

1. Encounter a Conflict
2. If unavoidable, Players must engage the Conflict
3. Engage the Conflict
4. Resolve the Conflict

#### Conflict Encounter

If an event would cause Players to make a decision, then a Conflict Encounter occurs. The Game Master then decides if the decision warrants a Conflict Engagement. The threshold for activating a Conflict Engagement is as follows.

| Decision Level | Decision Type  | Description                                       | Examples                                     | Conflict Engagement |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0              | Programmed     | Decisions that are repetitive or routine          | Picking up your toothbrush                   | No                  |
| 1              | Non-Programmed | Decisions that occur as small exceptions          | Avoiding a small puddle                      | No                  |
| 2              | Minor          | Decisions that require some effort to make        | Avoiding a large puddle in a narrow alleyway | Yes                 |
| 3              | Major          | Decisions that require significant effort to make | Avoiding a sinkhole in a bus going 70 mph    | Yes                 |
