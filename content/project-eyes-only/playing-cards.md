## Using the Playing Cards

Players may each use their own set of playing cards to help them answer questions, or when instructed to by the Game Master. The following rules are applied when playing cards are required.

## Setup

### 1. Deck Setup

Before an encounter, each Player has:

1. Acquired a standard 52-card deck
2. Set aside the Joker cards in a separate pile\*
3. Setup their Action Book

\*Some decks come with extra informational or promotional cards: these are excluded and are not used

### 2. Encounter Setup

Before an encounter, the Game Master has:

1. Determined the question(s) to ask the Players
2. Determined the Challenge Ratings of each question

### 3. Turn Order

When an encounter is declared by the Game Master:

1. The first turn is determined by the Game Master
2. Each successive turn is then determined by the Game Master and the Players

### 4. First Draw

1. At the beginning of each encounter, each Player draws 5 cards from their Main Deck

## Gameplay

### Playing the cards

In Turn Order, the Player:

1. Must ready any exhausted Combinations
2. May play 1 Normal Combination if able; else, skip this step
3. May play any number of Special Combinations if able; else, skip this step
4. May spend a Combination by exhausting it if able; else, skip to Step 7
5. Pay for an Action with spent Combinations
6. May go to Step 4 if able; else, skip this step
7. Pass the turn

The Game Master may choose to follow these steps when it is the turn of a Non-Player Character.

## Encounter Characteristics

### Card Ratings

Each numbered playing card (2-10) has an assigned numerical rating depicted explicitly on the card. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King, Ace) do not have a rating.

### Card Rankings

- The ranking of the cards is: `A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2`.
- The ranking of the suits is: `Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades`.
- The card number takes precedence over the suit.

### Challenge Ratings

Each question has a Challenge Rating. A Challenge Rating represents the relative difficulty of a question in comparison to the Player Characters. Challenge Ratings are set by the Game Master and can be changed by Actions.

Each question type has a recommended base Challenge Rating.

| Question type   | Base Challenge Rating |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Question**    |                       |
| Trivial         | 0                     |
| Easy            | 2                     |
| **Question I**  |                       |
| Medium          | 3-6                   |
| Hard            | 7-10                  |
| **Question II** |                       |
| Miracle         | 11+                   |

### Actions

Actions are things that the Players can have their Player Characters do.

### Action Ratings

Each Action performed has an Action Rating. An Action Rating is determined by the Action itself.

### Failed Outcomes

A failed outcome is generally achieved by not meeting the minimum Challenge Rating with an Action Rating.

### Successful Outcomes

A successful outcome is generally achieved by meeting or exceeding the Challenge Rating with an Action Rating.

### Example: Can the Player climb a cliff?

1. The Gamer Master and Player identify a question

   - Can the Player climb the cliff with their Player Character?

1. The Game Master sets the Challenge Rating of the question, based on the Player Character

   - The Player Character has climbed cliffs before, and so the Game Master sets the Challenge Rating at a 4
   - However, the cliff is wet due to the weather, so the Game Master adds 2 to the Challenge Rating
   - This sets the total Challenge Rating of this question to 6
   - The Game Master may chose to make this rating known to the party

1. The Player plays a Combination

   - They play a Pair of 3s
   - This grants them a Combination total of 6 to spend on actions

1. The Player spends Combinations on the Climbing Prowess Action

   - They exhaust the Pair of 3s
   - They activate their Climbing Prowess Action from their Action Book
   - This brings their Combination total down to 0

1. The Player uses his Climbing Prowess Action

   - This Action allows the Player's character to weather weather conditions when climbing, adding 2 to this Action Rating
   - This Action grants a free climb action using the Action's cost as the Action Rating, being 6
   - This Action's total Action Rating is 8

1. Compare and Resolve the Ratings

   - The Player's Action has a total Action Rating of 8
   - The question has a Challenge Rating of 6
   - The Player has a higher rating than the Challenge Rating, and thus generates a successful outcome, or answer, to the question
   - The Game Master and Player may both describe the character climbing the cliff
