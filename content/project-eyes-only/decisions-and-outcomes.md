## Decisions

A decision is an answer to a question, it can be right or wrong. The Group will be required to make decisions throughout play in the World. Decisions can vary wildly, as there are both simple and complex questions to answer when interacting with the World.

Most simple questions can be answered definitively or rather easily. Complex questions, on the other hand, may require more engagement and thought. The World should be able to pose an entire spectrum of questions for the Players to answer. In turn, the Players may choose to answer questions of their liking, motivated by their own selves and by the World itself.

The Game Master is here to aid the Players in decision making. Certain questions are easy, and the Game Master should confirm their thoughts with these types of questions. This lets both the Players and the World proceed smoothly with questions that are trivial.

Certain questions are hard, and the Game Master should also work with the Players to answer these more complex questions.

In general, a game is a collaboration between the Game Master and the Players to answer questions of varying complexity.

To help answer more complex questions, the Game Master may employ the Decision Making Tool: playing cards.

## Question Types

### Question

An outcome from a Question should not require the use of playing cards, and are determined by just using the characteristics of the Player Characters.

#### Trivial Questions

Questions that occur everyday and often require no thought.

#### Easy Questions

Questions that occur daily and often require little to no thought.

### Question I

An outcome from a Question I should generally be determined by the use of both the characteristics of the Player Characters and the playing cards.

#### Medium Questions

Questions that occur infrequently and are often exceptions. A Player generally has a 50/50 chance of being knowledgeable about the question.

#### Hard Questions

Questions that rarely occur and are often unexpected.

### Question II

An outcome from a Question II is generally determined to be impossible for Player Characters. Player Characters generally need more experience and time to resolve this kind of question.

#### Miracle Questions

Questions that are once-in-a-lifetime and are often unimaginable.

### Question Thresholds

The Game Master may choose when playing cards should be used, and the following provides only suggested thresholds, that when reached, then should playing cards be used to help answer questions and determine outcomes.

| Question type   | Use playing cards |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| **Question**    |                   |
| Trivial         | No                |
| Easy            | No                |
| **Question I**  |                   |
| Medium          | Interpretive      |
| Hard            | Yes               |
| **Question II** |                   |
| Miracle         | No                |

## Outcomes

An outcome is what occurs after a question is answered, or a decision is made. Outcomes are generally described and provided by the Game Master. The Game Master can employ characteristics of the Player Characters to determine outcomes. In addition, characteristics provided by the use of playing cards should also inform the Game Master on how outcomes are determined.

## Determining Outcomes

The Game Master identifies the question type and applies the appropriate characteristics to determine the outcome. Characteristics may come from either the Player Characters, the playing cards, or both.

Player Character characteristics may include things like backstory and skills, while playing card characteristics generally involve actions and ratings derived from the playing cards.

## Using the Playing Cards

Players may each use their own set of playing cards to help them answer questions, or when instructed to by the Game Master. The following rules are applied when playing cards are required.

### A. Deck Setup

Before an encounter, each player has:

1. Acquired a standard 52-card deck
2. Set aside the Joker cards in a separate pile\*
3. Setup their Action Book

\*Some decks come with extra informational or promotional cards: these are excluded and are not used

### B. Encounters

An encounter occurs whenever a Question I or higher is being answered. Encounters are used to help group together a set of steps taken in order to answer a question.

### 1. Turn Order

When an encounter is declared by the Game Master:

1. The first turn is determined by the Game Master
2. Each successive turn is then determined by the Game Master and the Players

### 2. First Draw

1. At the beginning of each encounter, each Player draws 5 cards from their Main Deck

### 3. Playing the cards

In Turn Order, the Player:

1. Must ready any exhausted combos
2. May play 1 Normal Combo if able; else, skip this step
3. May play any number of Special Combos if able; else, skip this step
4. May spend a Combo by exhausting it if able; else, skip to Step 7
5. Pay for an Action with spent Combo
6. May go to Step 4 if able; else, skip this step
7. Pass the turn

### Card Ratings

Each numbered playing card (2-10) has an assigned numerical rating depicted explicitly on the card. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King, Ace) do not have a rating.

### Challenge Ratings

Each question has a challenge rating. A challenge rating represents the relative difficulty of a question in comparison to the Player Characters.

Each question type has a recommended base challenge rating.

| Question type   | Base challenge rating |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Question**    |                       |
| Trivial         | 0                     |
| Easy            | 2                     |
| **Question I**  |                       |
| Medium          | 3-6                   |
| Hard            | 7-10                  |
| **Question II** |                       |
| Miracle         | 11+                   |

### Action Ratings

Each Action performed has an Action Rating. An Action Rating is determined by the Action itself. If no such rating is supplied, the Combos spent for the Action is used instead as the Action Rating.

### Failed Outcomes

A failed outcome, or a failed answer to a question, is generally achieved by not achieving at least the minimum Challenge Rating with Card Ratings.

### Successful Outcomes

A successful outcome, or a successful answer to a question, is generally achieved by achieving or exceeding the Challenge Rating with Card Ratings.

### Example: Can the Player climb a cliff?

1. The Game Master sets the Challenge Rating of the question, based on the Player's character, to 6

   - In this instance, the character has climbed cliffs before, and so sets the Challenge Rating at 4
   - However, the cliff is wet due to the weather, which adds 2 to the Challenge Rating

2. The Player plays a Combo

   - They play a Pair of 3s

3. The Player spends the Combo on the Climbing Prowess Action

   - They exhaust the Pair of 3s

4. The Player uses his Climbing Prowess Action

   - This Action allows the Player's character to weather weather conditions when climbing, adding 2 to this Action Rating
   - This Action grants a free climb action using the Action's cost as the Action Rating, being 6
   - This Action's total Action Rating is 8

5. Compare and Resolve the Ratings

   - The Player's Action has a total Action Rating of 8
   - The question has a Challenge Rating of 6
   - The Player has a higher rating than the challenge rating, and thus generates a successful outcome, or answer, to the question
   - The Game Master and Player may both describe the character answering--or overcoming, the question--or cliff.
