## Decisions

A decision is an answer to a question, it can be right or wrong. The Group will be required to make decisions throughout play in the World. Decisions can vary wildly, as there are both simple and complex questions to answer when interacting with the World.

Most simple questions can be answered definitively or rather easily. Complex questions, on the other hand, may require more engagement and thought. The World should be able to pose an entire spectrum of questions for the Players to answer. In turn, the Players may choose to answer questions of their liking, motivated by their own selves and by the World itself.

The Game Master is here to aid the Players in decision making. Certain questions are easy, and the Game Master should confirm their thoughts with these types of questions. This lets both the Players and the World proceed smoothly with questions that are trivial.

Certain questions are hard, and the Game Master should also work with the Players to answer these more complex questions.

In general, a game is a collaboration between the Game Master and the Players to answer questions of varying complexity.

To help answer more complex questions, the Game Master may employ the Decision Making Tool: playing cards.

### Question Types

#### Trivial Questions

Questions that occur everyday and often require no thought.

#### Easy Questions

Questions that occur daily and often require little to no thought.

#### Medium Questions

Questions that occur infrequently and are often exceptions. A Player generally has a 50/50 chance of being knowledgeable about the question.

#### Hard Questions

Questions that rarely occur and are often unexpected.

#### Miracle Questions

Questions that are once-in-a-lifetime and are often unimaginable.

### Question Thresholds

The Game Master may choose when playing cards should be used, and the following provides only suggested thresholds, that when reached, then should playing cards be used to help answer questions and determine outcomes.

| Question type | Use playing cards |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| **Level 0**   | -                 |
| Trivial       | No                |
| Easy          | No                |
| **Level 1**   | -                 |
| Medium        | Interpretive      |
| Hard          | Yes               |
| **Level 2**   | -                 |
| Miracle       | No                |

## Outcomes

An outcome is what occurs after a question is answered, or a decision is made. Outcomes are generally described and provided by the Game Master. The Game Master can employ characteristics of the Player Characters to determine outcomes. In addition, characteristics provided by the use of playing cards should also inform the Game Master on how outcomes are determined.

## Determining Outcomes

The Game Master identifies the question type and applies the appropriate characteristics to determine the outcome.

### Level 0 Outcomes

An outcome from a Level 0 Question should not require the use of playing cards, and are determined by just using the characteristics of the Player Characters.

### Level 1 Outcomes

An outcome from a Level 1 Question should generally be determined by the use of both the characteristics of the Player Characters and playing cards.

### Level 2 Outcomes

An outcome from a Level 2 Question is generally determined to be impossible for Player Characters. Player Characters generally need more experience and time to resolve this kind of question.

## Using Playing Cards

Players may each use their own set of playing cards to help them answer questions, or when instructed to by the Game Master. The following rules are applied when playing cards are required.

### Deck Setup

Each player has:

1. Acquired a standard 52-card deck
2. Set aside the Joker cards in a separate pile
3. Set aside any extra cards provided in the deck
4. Setup their Action Book

### Turn Order

- The first turn is determined by the Game Master
- Each successive turn is determined by the Game Master and the Players

## Conflict

A conflict is a disagreement between Players and the World. The World can include many entities that conflict with the Player, such as: another Player, Non-Player Characters, and the World's environment.

### Examples

A conflict may occur between a Player and the following:

- Another Player
- A Non-Player Character
- The environment
  - Monsters, terrain, and the climate and weather

### Conflict Resolution

This section describes how to use the tools provided in order to resolve Conflicts.

#### Playing Cards

Players will use a standard deck of cards as their primary tool to resolve Conflicts. A standard deck of cards, also known as a French deck, contains the following qualities:

- 52 total cards
  - 13 ranks of cards, with 4 of each card in each rank
    - 9 number cards: 2 through 10
    - 4 face cards: Jack, Queen, King, and Ace
  - 4 suits: Spades, Clubs, Diamonds, and Hearts
  - 2 colors: Diamonds and Hearts are in red, while Spades and Clubs are in black
    - If red and black are not present, at least two colors in the deck must be designated as red and the other black
  - Joker cards are not included in the deck unless otherwise stated

#### Conflict Encounter

If an event would cause Players to make a decision, then a Conflict Encounter occurs. The following describes the types of decisions Players may encounter.

| Decision Level | Decision Type  | Description                                       | Example                                             | Conflict Engagement |

| 2              | Minor          | Decisions that require effort to make             | Deciding what to wear for a party                   | Yes                 |
| 3              | Major          | Decisions that require significant effort to make | Deciding what to wear for your wedding              | Yes                 |

#### Conflict Engagement

Once a threshold is met or exceeded during a Conflict Encounter, a Conflict Engagement occurs as determined by the Game Master. She may choose to ignore an encounter even though a threshold is met.

This Engagement allows the Group to resolve the Conflict before proceeding with the Party's next action.

Each Player in the Party will take turns in order to process the Conflict Encounter.

The following describes how to resolve a Conflict Encounter.

#### Steps

Players will take turns in Turn Order, determined in Step 1, beginning at Step 2.

0. Narrative Actions
   - During any step, the Player may perform Narrative Actions
1. Determination
   - The Players must determine the Turn Order
   - The Players then each draw 5 cards
2. Draw
   - The Player must draw 1 card from their Main Deck
3. Main
   - The Player may perform Mana Activations
   - The Player may perform Skill Activations from their Skill Book
4. Engagement

### Narrative Actions

### Turn Order

Turn Order determines the order by which Players will take their turns during a Conflict Encounter. The following describes the steps to determine Turn Order.

1.  If it is the first turn, determine Turn Order
2.  Each Player draws 1 card from their Main Deck
3.  The Player with the highest ranked card (by suit, face, then number) becomes the first player in Turn Order
    - If a Player draws the 2 of Hearts, they then get to decide the Turn Order
4.  Each Player draws 5 cards from their Main Deck
